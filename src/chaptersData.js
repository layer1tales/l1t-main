        text: <>
        <p>In the near future, the metaverse blurred the lines between reality and a fantasy world cooked up by anonymous developers. Even worse, everyone was using it one way or another. Some people lost themselves chasing down imaginary cartoon monsters in the alleyways of virtual cities, while others attempted to educate themselves through a six-month course in a simulated classroom. Truth be told, most of them tried to get off to AI-generated pornography that made the porn stars look like people they knew in real life.</p>

        <p>No one blamed the people who fled to the metaverse. It was a breath of fresh air compared to the mind-numbing bullshit of the real world. When corporations weren't bombarding the masses with prompts to buy more stuff, they were tearing the world down and dumping poison into the atmosphere and water. Talking heads rehashed the same tired subjects every week and called it news, distracting the public with pointless things to keep their focus off the wealthy running the real world. There was no shortage of politicians who had long ago abandoned all sense of decency and bickered back and forth like children.</p>

        <p>The metaverse offered a welcoming alternative.</p>

        <p>Solana pondered whether the world needed to be that way. What if people didn't need to retreat into the metaverse? What if it was normal, everyday life that changed?</p>

        <p>These were the questions that once kept Solana up at night. And although these questions didn't have easy answers, the answers were there; she just needed to find them.</p>

        <p>The day had finally arrived when Solana would again meet face to face with her long-term rival yet mentor. The man operated out of a seemingly abandoned industrial complex outside San Diego. She opened a heavy fire door – something not originally intended to open from the outside. With bent rebar welded into it, she let herself inside a dimly lit room filled with thousands of blinking purple and blue lights of computer servers.</p>

        <p>The whirring fans created a quiet, constant hum.</p>

        <p>She found the man standing hunched over a keyboard in the back corner, typing on his keyboard while talking on the phone. The glow of four screens outlined him from the front like a shadow.</p>

        <p>"I'll call you back, beautiful redhead."</p>

        <p>"Good to see you again, Solana," the man said without turning around. "You're just in time. I think I've done it."</p>

        <p>"What do you mean 'it'?" Solana asked. She narrowed her eyes, "Surely you don't mean... it."</p>

        <p>"I do."</p>

        <p>Ethereum turned and opened his hand. There was a shimmering holographic glyph floating just an inch above his palm. Solana's eyes opened wide at the sight of the object.</p>

        <p>"You can't be serious," she whispered. "Tell me you're not serious."</p>

        <p>"Oh, I'm serious," Ethereum replied, admiring his handiwork. "It looks so simple, doesn't it? This is everything I've been searching for. The power to control not just what's out there to consume but what people want to consume. This is it, Solana! Beyond even—"</p>

        <p>Ethereum was cut short by an explosion. A cloud of dense smoke suddenly filled the server room from what appeared to be canister-type grenades. Solana instinctively sprinted towards him, grabbed the digital artifact, and dashed off into the rows of servers. The skylights burst open, and a platoon of SWAT soldiers dropped down with a shower of glass shards.</p>

        <p>Ethereum recoiled from the falling glass, spinning around and covering his face. Meanwhile, Solana dropped to the ground and laid motionless, doing her best to remain undetected. A SWAT soldier patrolled close by before rejoining the squad.</p>

        <p>Ethereum was dropped to the floor by a jackboot to the back of his knee. He was seized under the armpits and swiftly dragged out of view.</p>

        <p>A man in a black suit let himself through the same access door Solana had used. A military laminate ID badge hung from his lapel, and she could barely make out the name: J. Powell. His patent leather shoes crunched through the broken glass as he approached Ethereum, who was fully restrained by two faceless soldiers in tactical gear.</p>

        <p>"So... Ethereum..." the man said. "Is that what you're calling yourself now? Did you think you could scrub your identity and the government would toss their hands up and assume you had vanished? Come on. Surely you know better than that."</p>

        <p>"I know a lot of things," Ethereum replied.</p>

        <p>The government man held his open palm and said, "Give it to me."</p>

        <p>"So, you can shuffle it up the ranks straight to everyone responsible?" He gritted his teeth. "You'll have to kill me."</p>

        <p>The government man casually took out a gun, cocked it, and placed the barrel on the programmer's forehead. "Don't tempt me; I'd rather not." He leaned in closer, bringing his lips to Ethereum's ear. "It can happen with your brain inside or outside of your head. That decision, my friend, is entirely up to you."</p>

        <p>The man stood and addressed his soldiers. "Take this piece of work back to the Department. Prosecute him for anything you can think of: obstruction, conspiracy, treason; pile it on!"</p>

        <p>The SWAT team dragged Ethereum away right past Solana, who laid invisible, crumpled on the floor.</p>

        <p>And then they were gone.</p>

        <p>Solana stood up when the room had been quiet for five minutes, and she was sure no one was coming back. She had never seen eye-to-eye with Ethereum, but they were begrudging allies against a common enemy. That same enemy had dealt a crushing blow to the uprising by arresting Ethereum. She stared off at the distant city lights of San Diego, and while she didn't know what to do, she knew she had to do something.</p>

        <p>Solana sprinted through the back alleyways of San Diego. She didn't know if Fed agents were following her or not, but she wasn't going to stop until she was sure they weren't tailing her.</p>
    
        <p>It was challenging to run with a backpack full of technical equipment swinging left to right on her back, pulling her off her center of balance. She occasionally stopped to catch her breath and adjust the straps over her shoulders.</p>

        <p>If the government knew what she had in her possession – Ethereum’s holographic glyph – they'd be all over her with military helicopters and security vehicles. Hell, they could just as easily switch all the traffic lights to blinking yellow, bring traffic to a screeching halt, and track her down on foot.</p>

        <p>She had to return to her residence, where her signal jammers and VPN connection could mask her electronic signature. Her dwelling had all the features needed to disrupt the government's stranglehold on society. Without her many precautions, she would have been spotted and captured by the Feds long ago.</p>

        <p>Solana felt confident enough to stop and rest while temporarily tucked away in the rear entrance of Mirabella, a Mediterranean restaurant. She leaned against the metal door and slumped to the ground. The adrenaline was starting to wear off. She could finally feel the toll the physical exertion had taken on her body: her feet were throbbing, her thighs and calf muscles burned like fire, and a low-level headache was growing in intensity along her temples.</p>

        <p>She sat there, gasping for air when she heard the flick of a lighter and saw a small orange flame illuminate a man's face. He had dark skin and hair, but when he spoke, he sounded like he had been born and raised in New York.</p>

        <p>"I knew you were fast, but I expected you to have more stamina," the man said, twiddling his two fingers to imitate a person running. "You must have gotten yourself into 33 different flavors of trouble."</p>

        <p>Solana squinted to catch a better glimpse of the man and quickly recognized him. After all, he sold his famous EVM-compatible blockchain to venture capitalists.</p>

        <p>"Avalanche?" she asked. "What are you doing here?"</p>

        <p>Avalanche chuckled, took a drag off his cigar, and blew a cloud of smoke into the air. "What am I doing anywhere?" he asked rhetorically. "The real question is, what are you doing here?" He glanced around at the dank alleyways surrounding them. "I highly doubt you decided to sprint through San Diego just to burn calories."</p>

        <p>Solana huffed; she wasn't exactly keen on the idea of sharing information with Avalanche. While she didn't trust him, she knew he wasn't working with the government, and that was all that mattered at the moment.</p>

        <p>"I'm lost," she said, which was true but not the whole truth. She winced in pain as she forced herself back on her feet. "Do you have a ride? Can you get me out of here?" She pleaded.</p>

        <p>"Oh, I have lots of rides," Avalanche replied, quite pleased. "Lamborghini, Bentley, Rolls-Royce." He peeped at Solana and added, "sometimes it's smart to know when to put the revolution on hold and just play ball." He took another drag of his cigar and blew a near-perfect smoke ring in the air.</p>

        <p>"Sure," Solana said, indignant. "Play ball. With the system."</p>

        <p>Avalanche chuckled again, "well, you don't see me sprinting through the alleyways running for my life."</p>

        <p>"That's because I'm doing something," Solana replied. "Now cut the bullshit. Are you going to give me a ride or not?"</p>

        <p>After some deep contemplation, Avalanche nodded and said, "I'll give you a ride."</p>

        <p>"Thank you," Solana grumbled. She hated being indebted to anyone, least of all Avalanche, and especially not for something as trivial as a ride.</p>

        <p>"For ten-thousand USDC," Avalanche added.</p>

        <p>"What?"</p>

        <p>"For ten-thousand USDC," Avalanche repeated. He saw the confusion on Solana's face as he shrugged and began to clarify. "I don't do anything for free. I don't think I can do anything for free. You know that, so enough with the sticker shock. You can afford it."</p>

        <p>She repeated the price so he could hear how absurd it sounded, "ten-thousand USDC? For a fucking ride across town?"</p>

        <p>"Okay," Avalanche put up his hands in defense, "I guess you could always walk." His eyes wandered wistfully to the night sky, illuminated by stars, streetlights, and the red and blue flashes of police lights. "There's a lot of security out tonight," he mused.</p>

        <p>Solana huffed once and glared at him, "fine," she growled, "ten-thousand USDC."</p>

        <p>"Look at us," Avalanche said, swinging his arm out and giving Solana a firm pat on the back, "Fast friends."</p>

        <p>Avalanche drove a brand new blacked-out Rolls-Royce with tinted windows. The seats were soft leather, the interior smelled like cologne, and the ceiling lit up like a glittering night sky made of thousands of fiber optic lights. Solana was disgusted by such an opulent display of wealth – especially since his purchase further contributed to the success of some money-hungry CEO who stepped on wage slaves to get richer. However, she couldn't deny that someone like Avalanche would be worth keeping on her good side.</p>

        <p>"Can I ask you a question?" Solana asked him.</p>

        <p>"Of course," Avalanche activated self-driving mode with a button, then turned towards her, "for a hundred USDC."</p>

        <p>"Goddammit, Avalanche."</p>

        <p>"What?" He replied, tensing up at her accusing tone. "You think I make the rules? If you'd like to ask me a question, you must give me a hundred USDC."</p>

        <p>Solana growled in frustration as she swiped her fingertip across the glossy screen of her electronic watch. She conjured up a holographic icon of the number 100 and flicked it at Avalanche. The number swirled through the air, caught in the gravity of Avalanche's watch, where it got sucked in and blinked out of existence.</p>

        <p>"Thank you," Avalanche said. "Now, what's your question?"</p>

        <p>"Why don't you ever get involved in the uprising?" She asked. "The government is running loose, destroying everything. People like Ethereum and I are doing everything we can to stop them while you're driving a Rolls-Royce."</p>

        <p>Avalanche interrupted Solana and said, "There are two certainties in life: death and taxes. I have good contacts in the government, and I value them dearly."</p>

        <p>Solana continued, "Corporations are cramming shitty imports down everyone's throats. Look" She pointed to a billboard advertising optical implants to enhance the metaverse experience. "Why don't you help us? Why don't you do something?"</p>

        <p>"Dammit, Solana, haven't you been listening?" Avalanche took his eyes off the road for just a moment to look Solana dead in the eyes. He leaned in closer and lowered his voice to a whisper, "I don't do anything for free."</p>

        <p>Solana carefully stuck to the shadows between the warehouses as she made her way home. Nowhere else in the city did she feel more protected from the prying surveillance of the government than in the nearly abandoned industrial district known as The Dump. For thirteen city blocks, she was surrounded by condemned warehouses half-filled with colossal machinery that was too expensive to repair and too heavy to move.</p>

        <p>It offered her no shortage of spare parts.</p>

        <p>Solana had taken up residence in a factory that, decades ago, was responsible for smelting and machining one and two-ton steel assemblies for construction equipment, like cranes and bulldozers. The ceilings were three stories high with grimy, broken windows across the top, making it look like an abandoned cathedral. Various machines were still inside; some were as big as dinosaurs and had conveyor belts. There were enormous pots for smelting steel and a network of catwalks that connected everything in a web of rusting wrought iron.</p>

        <p>This warehouse came with benefits that the others did not. Because of the dangerous heavy machinery inside, the ceilings were supported by lead beams, and the walls were molded from high-density concrete. Here, government drones searching for electromagnetic signals or heat signatures would yield fruitless results. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, Solana's factory was as barren and lifeless as the rest of the district. Inside the warehouse, things were very different.</p>

        <p>On the third story, there were offices where labor managers and safety inspectors once observed the industrial work on the floor below. Those offices were home to Solana's sprawling technological network. State-of-the-art servers sat stacked next to one another, daisy-chained with loops of thick cables. They blinked with hundreds of green and blue lights, hinting at the terabytes of information flowing through her dark, echoing home.</p>

        <p>She pushed all the old desks together and stacked dozens of computer screens, each displaying a glimpse of the real world and the metaverse. There were news broadcasts, dashboards about her network, social media feeds about the latest DeFi/NFT projects, and multiple code editors. Solana wasn't going to risk missing a shred of information. Everything from geopolitical tensions to the number of transactions per second on her blockchain was worth analyzing.</p>

        <p>Nothing in the world happened in a vacuum; everything was tied together.</p>

        <p>She dragged a rolling computer chair across the concrete floors; its wheels were coming apart and rattling on its last legs. She spun it around so she could take a seat. As she settled in away from the intrusive eyes of a technological world monitored by government agencies, she felt safe enough to remove the holographic glyph she had managed to swipe from Ethereum's lab during his arrest.</p>

        <p>She held it in her hands as it floated there, slowly rotating in place, glowing as if it came from a simulated heaven of digital information. This was everything Ethereum had been working towards and why he had been arrested. She knew that something so powerful and sophisticated wouldn't be push-button easy. Nevertheless, she had to understand what it was and how she could crack it.</p>

        <p>She bit her bottom lip, reaching up to open the glyph with the hopes of getting a better look at the information stored inside. When the three-dimensional logo opened, it released a cloud of programming language that floated into the air like vapor. The lines of code arranged themselves in precise order, with everything carefully locked into place. The outer layers of code orbited the glyph like a hand-held galaxy of letters that were similar to yet different from DNA encryption.</p>

        <p>As she tilted her head one way and the other, furrowing her brow in a vain attempt to understand, she came to a slow realization. Whatever Ethereum was working on, whatever he had discovered, was beyond her understanding.</p>

        <p>That was no easy feat; Solana knew twelve programming languages. When she was a kid, she had learned C++ before she could even speak English. Despite all her coding skills, she could not comprehend what she was looking at for the life of her.</p>

        <p>"It's brilliant," she whispered as she traced her fingers through the holographic display of code. "Or insane," she sighed, frustrated, and leaned back in her chair. "I guess it could be both."</p>

        <p>She found it annoying that potentially everything she had been working towards, a complete tear-down of the old system and the birth of a new one, was in her hands but undecipherable. The only person who knew what this computerized gibberish was supposed to say, or do, was Ethereum. Unfortunately, he was on an all-expenses-paid trip to a blacklisted detention cell.</p>

        <p>She decided to pursue her glyph research on Web3. While browsing, she saw the "Connect the Dots" online ad for a community event sponsored by a rival blockchain. Suddenly, Solana's eyebrows perked up as a thought occurred to her. She might not know what this code said, but that didn't mean nobody else did.</p>

        <p>Years ago, Solana remembered that Ethereum had worked closely with a hacker named Polkadot. The two never got along, but they had tried to get along, at least for a short while. Even though they notoriously argued all the time, it's impossible to argue about code if the other person doesn't know what you’re talking about.</p>

        <p>Polkadot didn't want to work with Ethereum on his project, probably because she didn't like it. However, if she didn't like it, she must have had a reason. Perhaps she might very well know how to read it. Just because she didn't like it didn't mean she didn't understand it; quite the contrary.</p>

        <p>It was a long shot, but it was Solana's only lead. However, it was slightly problematic that she had never met Polkadot before. It would have been easier to get into her Torrey Pines Estate undetected if she had been invited, but that didn't make it impossible. It just meant she would have to use more caution than usual.</p>

        <p>Solana waved her hand through the air, sifting her fingers through the floating cloud of holographic code, and summoned it back to the diamond-shaped casing. The logo sealed itself closed and trapped the mysterious language inside.</p>

        <p>Polkadot diversified her money in many asset classes around the world. The extent of her wealth was a complete mystery to both governments and corporations.</p>

        <p>The seemingly random ups and downs of finances were nothing more than an optical illusion to her. In the morning, she would sip coffee in her sterile white breakfast nook surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass windows and stare at a tablet of streaming stock market quotes. An intense day on the New York Stock Exchange could swing prices on the Shanghai Stock Exchange with rippling effects that would spill out on the Euronext Exchange.</p>

        <p>If she squinted her eyes just right to blur her vision, the red and green numbers would start to take shape, revealing swirling patterns resembling frequency wavelengths. By identifying the sweeping curves of information, Polkadot could see trends and patterns invisible to even the most intuitive stockbroker.</p>

        <p>Like a prescient analyst, she sensed when inflation would rise and when a global housing bubble would burst months beforehand. Her ability to recognize small yet significant details was uncanny. She could expertly shuffle her money away from pitfalls and collapses that would have left most people flat broke.</p>

        <p>Her transactions were nothing short of miraculous. When a seemingly worthless company would get scooped up by a mega-corporation, and their pitiful shares would suddenly skyrocket, Polkadot would predict the trend before it started and acquire a sizeable equity stake.</p>

        <p>Polkadot did not accumulate wealth because she needed it; she wasn't in the game for fame or money. She was in it for the raw numbers. She liked figuring them out, predicting what they might do, and, more than anything, being right.</p>

        <p>What Polkadot did not much care for was the sudden ring of her doorbell at 6:11 am, right before the US stock market opened on the East Coast.</p>

        <p>"How is that even possible?" she said to herself. She had a front-gated domain and a top-of-the-line security system with motion detectors leading to her doorstep. Still, the intruder had managed to dodge all the alarms and straight-up ring her doorbell.</p>

        <p>She hadn't bothered to change out of her outfit from the night before: a black velvet dress adorned with hundreds of tiny white polka dots. This attention-grabbing fashion statement caught the eye of all the coked-up stockbrokers who went out to the nightclubs. They would flash their money, get trashed on high-priced cocktails, and share material non-public information.</p>

        <p>She wasn't necessarily hung over, but she was in no mood to entertain guests. Glancing at stock charts on her tablet, she thought she could return her attention to trading and hoped the bothersome stranger on her porch would disappear. Shortly after she fixed her eyes on the screen, the doorbell rang again.</p>

        <p>With a groan, she rose to her feet and arched her back to stretch out – Might as well, if I'm going to be flipping standing, she thought to herself – as she made her way to the front entrance. It was a long walk through her palatial estate, past a library of books she would never read, through a parlor of furniture she had never touched, and to a front door of solid African blackwood.</p>

        <p>A loud clack came from the brass handles of the door, releasing the catch. Using both hands and putting all her 105 pounds of weight into it, Polkadot dragged the solid exotic slab open.</p>

        <p>A filthy hacker who looked exhausted and out of breath was standing on the porch, caught in the glorious light of a California sunrise. Polkadot tilted her head as she gave the intruding girl a sideways glance, almost sure she had seen her before.</p>

        <p>"Polkadot?" The uninvited visitor asked.</p>

        <p>Polkadot squinted as if she could see into the frequency of the hacker's life in an attempt to crack the code of her existence before anyone could say it out loud, but it didn't work. Her intuition was that the girl standing on her porch wasn't a run-of-the-mill hacker who had seen too many Hollywood movies.</p>

        <p>"Do I know you?" Polkadot asked.</p>

        <p>"I'm Solana," the girl said, introducing herself. "I'm… well, I'm not friends with Ethereum, but I know him. Knew him. Knew him or know him, I'm not too sure. The government has prosecuted him."</p>

        <p>Polkadot harumphed at the fate of Ethereum. She wasn't fond of the man and his wild, mad-scientist approach to numbers and code. She wasn't surprised that his hair-brained ideas had landed him on the receiving end of a government raid.</p>

        <p>"Being friends with Ethereum does not impress me," Polkadot said. "So, if you're looking for someone to help you free that crypto punk from government detention-"</p>

        <p>"I'm not," Solana said, interrupting. "That's not why I'm here. I'm here to show you this," Solana held out her cupped hands and offered up the holographic glyph that had eluded her genius. "This is what Ethereum was working on when he called me and what he was showing me when the government busted in and dragged him away. Whatever its meaning, it's dangerous enough to bring the Feds crashing down on everyone's heads."</p>

        <p>Polkadot took a cautious step back. "Oh, thank you so much for bringing it here."</p>

        <p>"I'll take it and leave," Solana said. "Just help me open it."</p>

        <p>"Me?" Polkadot asked. "Why me? I've never seen that thing before in my life."</p>

        <p>"No, but you've worked with Ethereum before," Solana said. "You're the only one who can figure out the complex coding language he came up with. It's all mixed up in this, and I'd be lucky if I could figure a single line out, let alone decode the whole thing."</p>

        <p>Polkadot frowned. She didn't want to code. She didn't want to help a stranger who unexpectedly showed up at her home on a random Thursday morning. And she certainly didn't want to go cracking open one of Ethereum's deranged projects.</p>

        <p>Solana could see the answer creeping up on Polkadot's face and spoke up before she could say no.</p>

        <p>"Please," Solana said. "I'm sorry for infiltrating your property, but you might be the only person able to decode this." She slid her hand into her pocket and fished out a handful of cash, a few hundred-dollar bills. "I'll pay you."</p>

        <p>Solana's hacking skills, mixed with her evident desperation, brought a smirk to Polkadot's face, followed by an involuntary laugh. A handful of cash was hilariously embarrassing to Polkadot, but she admired the gesture regardless of Solana's hopelessness.</p>

        <p>"Alright," Polkadot said. "You're funny. I like you." She stepped to the side and gestured for Solana to enter. "Let's look at what we're working with here."</p>
