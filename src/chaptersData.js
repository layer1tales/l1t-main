            <p>In the near future, the metaverse blurred the lines between reality and a fantasy world cooked up by
                anonymous developers. Even worse, everyone was using it one way or another. Some people lost themselves
                chasing down imaginary cartoon monsters in the alleyways of virtual cities, while others attempted to
                educate themselves through a six-month course in a simulated classroom. Truth be told, most of them
                tried to get off to AI-generated
                pornography that made the porn stars look like people they knew in real life.</p>
            <p>No one blamed the people who fled to the metaverse. It was a breath of fresh air compared
                to the mind-numbing bullshit of the real world. When corporations weren't bombarding the
                masses with prompts to buy more stuff, they were tearing the world down and dumping
                poison into
                the atmosphere and water. Talking heads rehashed the same tired subjects every week and
                called it news, distracting the public with pointless things to keep their focus off the
                wealthy running the real world. There was no shortage of politicians who had long ago
                abandoned
                all sense of decency and bickered back and forth like children.</p>
            <p>The metaverse offered a welcoming alternative</p>
            <p>Solana pondered whether the world needed to be that way. What if people didn't need to
                retreat into the metaverse? What if it was normal, everyday life that changed?</p>
            <p>These were the questions that once kept Solana up at night. And although these questions
                didn't have easy answers, the answers were there; she just needed to find them.</p>
            <p>The day had finally arrived when Solana would again meet face to face with her long-term
                rival yet mentor. The man operated out of a seemingly abandoned industrial complex
                outside
                San Diego. She opened a heavy fire door – something not originally intended to open from
                the
                outside. With bent rebar welded into it, she let herself inside a dimly lit room filled
                with
                thousands of blinking purple and blue lights of computer servers.</p>
            <p>The whirring fans created a quiet, constant hum</p>
            <p>She found the man standing hunched over a keyboard in the back corner, typing on his
                keyboard while talking on the phone. The glow of four screens outlined him from the
                frontlike a shadow.</p>
            <p>"I'll call you back, beautiful redhead."</p>
            <p>"Good to see you again, Solana," the man said without turning around. "You're just in
                time. I think I've done it."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean 'it'?" Solana asked. She narrowed her eyes, "Surely you don't mean...
                it."</p>
            <p>"I do."</p>
            <p>Ethereum turned and opened his hand. There was a shimmering holographic glyph floating
                just
                an inch above his palm. Solana's eyes opened wide at the sight of the object.</p>
            <p>"You can't be serious," she whispered. "Tell me you're not serious."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I'm serious," Ethereum replied, admiring his handiwork. "It looks so simple, doesn't
                it? This is everything I've been 9 | L1T Labs 1 3 3 7 W a r s searching for. The
                power to control not just what's out there to consume but what people want to consume.
                This
                is it, Solana! Beyond even—"</p>
            <p>Ethereum was cut short by an explosion. A cloud of dense smoke suddenly filled the server
                room from what appeared to be canister-type grenades. Solana instinctively sprinted
                towards
                him, grabbed the digital artifact, and dashed off into the rows of servers. The
                skylights
                burst open, and a platoon of SWAT soldiers dropped down with a shower of glass
                shards.</p>
            <p>Ethereum recoiled from the falling glass, spinning around and covering his face.
                Meanwhile,
                Solana dropped to the ground and laid motionless, doing her best to remain undetected. A
                SWAT soldier patrolled close by before rejoining the squad.</p>
            <p>Ethereum was dropped to the floor by a jackboot to the back of his knee. He was seized
                under
                the armpits and swiftly dragged out of view.</p>
            <p>A man in a black suit let himself through the same access door Solana had used. A
                military
                laminate ID badge hung from his lapel, and she could barely make out the name: J.
                Powell.
                His patent leather shoes crunched through the broken glass as he approached Ethereum,
                who
                was fully restrained by two faceless soldiers in tactical gear.</p>
            <p>"So... Ethereum..." the man said. "Is that what you're calling yourself now? Did you
                think
                you could scrub your identity and the government would toss their hands up and assume
                you
                had vanished? Come on. Surely you know better than that."</p>
            <p>"I know a lot of things," Ethereum replied.</p>
            <p>The government man held his open palm and said, "Give it to me."</p>
            <p>"So, you can shuffle it up the ranks straight to everyone responsible?" He gritted his
                teeth. "You'll have to kill me."</p>
            <p>The government man casually took out a gun, cocked it, and placed the barrel on the
                programmer's forehead. "Don't tempt me; I'd rather not." He leaned in closer, bringing
                his
                lips to Ethereum's ear. "It can happen with your brain inside or outside of your head.
                That
                decision, my friend, is entirely up to you."</p>
            <p>The man stood and addressed his soldiers. "Take this piece of work back to the
                Department.
                Prosecute him for anything you can think of: obstruction, conspiracy, treason; pile it
                on!"</p>
            <p>The SWAT team dragged Ethereum away right past Solana, who laid invisible, crumpled on
                the
                floor.</p>
            <p>And then they were gone.</p>
            <p>Solana stood up when the room had been quiet for five minutes, and she was sure no one
                was
                coming back. She had never seen eye-to-eye with Ethereum, but they were begrudging
                allies
                against a common enemy. That same enemy had dealt a crushing blow to the uprising by
                arresting Ethereum. She stared off at the distant city lights of San Diego, and while
                she
                didn't know what to do, she knew she had to do something.</p>
