        text: <>
            <p>In the near future, the metaverse blurred the lines between reality and a fantasy world cooked up by
                anonymous developers. Even worse, everyone was using it one way or another. Some people lost themselves
                chasing down imaginary cartoon monsters in the alleyways of virtual cities, while others attempted to
                educate themselves through a six-month course in a simulated classroom. Truth be told, most of them
                tried to get off to AI-generated pornography that made the porn stars look like people they knew in real
                life.</p>

            <p>No one blamed the people who fled to the metaverse. It was a breath of fresh air compared to the
                mind-numbing bullshit of the real world. When corporations weren't bombarding the masses with prompts to
                buy more stuff, they were tearing the world down and dumping poison into the atmosphere and water.
                Talking heads rehashed the same tired subjects every week and called it news, distracting the public
                with pointless things to keep their focus off the wealthy running the real world. There was no shortage
                of politicians who had long ago abandoned all sense of decency and bickered back and forth like
                children.</p>

            <p>The metaverse offered a welcoming alternative.</p>

            <p>Solana pondered whether the world needed to be that way. What if people didn't need to retreat into the
                metaverse? What if it was normal, everyday life that changed?</p>

            <p>These were the questions that once kept Solana up at night. And although these questions didn't have easy
                answers, the answers were there; she just needed to find them.</p>

            <p>The day had finally arrived when Solana would again meet face to face with her long-term rival yet
                mentor. The man operated out of a seemingly abandoned industrial complex outside San Diego. She opened a
                heavy fire door – something not originally intended to open from the outside. With bent rebar welded
                into it, she let herself inside a dimly lit room filled with thousands of blinking purple and blue
                lights of computer servers.</p>

            <p>The whirring fans created a quiet, constant hum.</p>

            <p>She found the man standing hunched over a keyboard in the back corner, typing on his keyboard while
                talking on the phone. The glow of four screens outlined him from the front like a shadow.</p>

            <p>"I'll call you back, beautiful redhead."</p>

            <p>"Good to see you again, Solana," the man said without turning around. "You're just in time. I think I've
                done it."</p>

            <p>"What do you mean 'it'?" Solana asked. She narrowed her eyes, "Surely you don't mean... it."</p>

            <p>"I do."</p>

            <p>Ethereum turned and opened his hand. There was a shimmering holographic glyph floating just an inch above
                his palm. Solana's eyes opened wide at the sight of the object.</p>

            <p>"You can't be serious," she whispered. "Tell me you're not serious."</p>

            <p>"Oh, I'm serious," Ethereum replied, admiring his handiwork. "It looks so simple, doesn't it? This is
                everything I've been searching for. The power to control not just what's out there to consume but what
                people want to consume. This is it, Solana! Beyond even—"</p>

            <p>Ethereum was cut short by an explosion. A cloud of dense smoke suddenly filled the server room from what
                appeared to be canister-type grenades. Solana instinctively sprinted towards him, grabbed the digital
                artifact, and dashed off into the rows of servers. The skylights burst open, and a platoon of SWAT
                soldiers dropped down with a shower of glass shards.</p>

            <p>Ethereum recoiled from the falling glass, spinning around and covering his face. Meanwhile, Solana
                dropped to the ground and laid motionless, doing her best to remain undetected. A SWAT soldier patrolled
                close by before rejoining the squad.</p>

            <p>Ethereum was dropped to the floor by a jackboot to the back of his knee. He was seized under the armpits
                and swiftly dragged out of view.</p>

            <p>A man in a black suit let himself through the same access door Solana had used. A military laminate ID
                badge hung from his lapel, and she could barely make out the name: J. Powell. His patent leather shoes
                crunched through the broken glass as he approached Ethereum, who was fully restrained by two faceless
                soldiers in tactical gear.</p>

            <p>"So... Ethereum..." the man said. "Is that what you're calling yourself now? Did you think you could
                scrub your identity and the government would toss their hands up and assume you had vanished? Come on.
                Surely you know better than that."</p>

            <p>"I know a lot of things," Ethereum replied.</p>

            <p>The government man held his open palm and said, "Give it to me."</p>

            <p>"So, you can shuffle it up the ranks straight to everyone responsible?" He gritted his teeth. "You'll
                have to kill me."</p>

            <p>The government man casually took out a gun, cocked it, and placed the barrel on the programmer's
                forehead. "Don't tempt me; I'd rather not." He leaned in closer, bringing his lips to Ethereum's ear.
                "It can happen with your brain inside or outside of your head. That decision, my friend, is entirely up
                to you."</p>

            <p>The man stood and addressed his soldiers. "Take this piece of work back to the Department. Prosecute him
                for anything you can think of: obstruction, conspiracy, treason; pile it on!"</p>

            <p>The SWAT team dragged Ethereum away right past Solana, who laid invisible, crumpled on the floor.</p>

            <p>And then they were gone.</p>

            <p>Solana stood up when the room had been quiet for five minutes, and she was sure no one was coming back.
                She had never seen eye-to-eye with Ethereum, but they were begrudging allies against a common enemy.
                That same enemy had dealt a crushing blow to the uprising by arresting Ethereum. She stared off at the
                distant city lights of San Diego, and while she didn't know what to do, she knew she had to do
                something.</p>

            <p>Solana sprinted through the back alleyways of San Diego. She didn't know if Fed agents were following her
                or not, but she wasn't going to stop until she was sure they weren't tailing her.</p>

            <p>It was challenging to run with a backpack full of technical equipment swinging left to right on her back,
                pulling her off her center of balance. She occasionally stopped to catch her breath and adjust the
                straps over her shoulders.</p>

            <p>If the government knew what she had in her possession – Ethereum’s holographic glyph – they'd be all over
                her with military helicopters and security vehicles. Hell, they could just as easily switch all the
                traffic lights to blinking yellow, bring traffic to a screeching halt, and track her down on foot.</p>

            <p>She had to return to her residence, where her signal jammers and VPN connection could mask her electronic
                signature. Her dwelling had all the features needed to disrupt the government's stranglehold on society.
                Without her many precautions, she would have been spotted and captured by the Feds long ago.</p>

            <p>Solana felt confident enough to stop and rest while temporarily tucked away in the rear entrance of
                Mirabella, a Mediterranean restaurant. She leaned against the metal door and slumped to the ground. The
                adrenaline was starting to wear off. She could finally feel the toll the physical exertion had taken on
                her body: her feet were throbbing, her thighs and calf muscles burned like fire, and a low-level
                headache was growing in intensity along her temples.</p>

            <p>She sat there, gasping for air when she heard the flick of a lighter and saw a small orange flame
                illuminate a man's face. He had dark skin and hair, but when he spoke, he sounded like he had been born
                and raised in New York.</p>

            <p>"I knew you were fast, but I expected you to have more stamina," the man said, twiddling his two fingers
                to imitate a person running. "You must have gotten yourself into 33 different flavors of trouble."</p>

            <p>Solana squinted to catch a better glimpse of the man and quickly recognized him. After all, he sold his
                famous EVM-compatible blockchain to venture capitalists.</p>

            <p>"Avalanche?" she asked. "What are you doing here?"</p>

            <p>Avalanche chuckled, took a drag off his cigar, and blew a cloud of smoke into the air. "What am I doing
                anywhere?" he asked rhetorically. "The real question is, what are you doing here?" He glanced around at
                the dank alleyways surrounding them. "I highly doubt you decided to sprint through San Diego just to
                burn calories."</p>

            <p>Solana huffed; she wasn't exactly keen on the idea of sharing information with Avalanche. While she
                didn't trust him, she knew he wasn't working with the government, and that was all that mattered at the
                moment.</p>

            <p>"I'm lost," she said, which was true but not the whole truth. She winced in pain as she forced herself
                back on her feet. "Do you have a ride? Can you get me out of here?" She pleaded.</p>

            <p>"Oh, I have lots of rides," Avalanche replied, quite pleased. "Lamborghini, Bentley, Rolls-Royce." He
                peeped at Solana and added, "sometimes it's smart to know when to put the revolution on hold and just
                play ball." He took another drag of his cigar and blew a near-perfect smoke ring in the air.</p>

            <p>"Sure," Solana said, indignant. "Play ball. With the system."</p>

            <p>Avalanche chuckled again, "well, you don't see me sprinting through the alleyways running for my
                life."</p>

            <p>"That's because I'm doing something," Solana replied. "Now cut the bullshit. Are you going to give me a
                ride or not?"</p>

            <p>After some deep contemplation, Avalanche nodded and said, "I'll give you a ride."</p>

            <p>"Thank you," Solana grumbled. She hated being indebted to anyone, least of all Avalanche, and especially
                not for something as trivial as a ride.</p>

            <p>"For ten-thousand USDC," Avalanche added.</p>

            <p>"What?"</p>

            <p>"For ten-thousand USDC," Avalanche repeated. He saw the confusion on Solana's face as he shrugged and
                began to clarify. "I don't do anything for free. I don't think I can do anything for free. You know
                that, so enough with the sticker shock. You can afford it."</p>

            <p>She repeated the price so he could hear how absurd it sounded, "ten-thousand USDC? For a fucking ride
                across town?"</p>

            <p>"Okay," Avalanche put up his hands in defense, "I guess you could always walk." His eyes wandered
                wistfully to the night sky, illuminated by stars, streetlights, and the red and blue flashes of police
                lights. "There's a lot of security out tonight," he mused.</p>

            <p>Solana huffed once and glared at him, "fine," she growled, "ten-thousand USDC."</p>

            <p>"Look at us," Avalanche said, swinging his arm out and giving Solana a firm pat on the back, "Fast
                friends."</p>

            <p>Avalanche drove a brand new blacked-out Rolls-Royce with tinted windows. The seats were soft leather, the
                interior smelled like cologne, and the ceiling lit up like a glittering night sky made of thousands of
                fiber optic lights. Solana was disgusted by such an opulent display of wealth – especially since his
                purchase further contributed to the success of some money-hungry CEO who stepped on wage slaves to get
                richer. However, she couldn't deny that someone like Avalanche would be worth keeping on her good
                side.</p>

            <p>"Can I ask you a question?" Solana asked him.</p>

            <p>"Of course," Avalanche activated self-driving mode with a button, then turned towards her, "for a hundred
                USDC."</p>

            <p>"Goddammit, Avalanche."</p>

            <p>"What?" He replied, tensing up at her accusing tone. "You think I make the rules? If you'd like to ask me
                a question, you must give me a hundred USDC."</p>

            <p>Solana growled in frustration as she swiped her fingertip across the glossy screen of her electronic
                watch. She conjured up a holographic icon of the number 100 and flicked it at Avalanche. The number
                swirled through the air, caught in the gravity of Avalanche's watch, where it got sucked in and blinked
                out of existence.</p>

            <p>"Thank you," Avalanche said. "Now, what's your question?"</p>

            <p>"Why don't you ever get involved in the uprising?" She asked. "The government is running loose,
                destroying everything. People like Ethereum and I are doing everything we can to stop them while you're
                driving a Rolls-Royce."</p>

            <p>Avalanche interrupted Solana and said, "There are two certainties in life: death and taxes. I have good
                contacts in the government, and I value them dearly."</p>

            <p>Solana continued, "Corporations are cramming shitty imports down everyone's throats. Look" She pointed to
                a billboard advertising optical implants to enhance the metaverse experience. "Why don't you help us?
                Why don't you do something?"</p>

            <p>"Dammit, Solana, haven't you been listening?" Avalanche took his eyes off the road for just a moment to
                look Solana dead in the eyes. He leaned in closer and lowered his voice to a whisper, "I don't do
                anything for free."</p>

        text: <>
            <p>Solana carefully stuck to the shadows between the warehouses as she made her way home. Nowhere else in
                the city did she feel more protected from the prying surveillance of the government than in the nearly
                abandoned industrial district known as The Dump. For thirteen city blocks, she was surrounded by
                condemned warehouses half-filled with colossal machinery that was too expensive to repair and too heavy
                to move.</p>

            <p>It offered her no shortage of spare parts.</p>

            <p>Solana had taken up residence in a factory that, decades ago, was responsible for smelting and machining
                one and two-ton steel assemblies for construction equipment, like cranes and bulldozers. The ceilings
                were three stories high with grimy, broken windows across the top, making it look like an abandoned
                cathedral. Various machines were still inside; some were as big as dinosaurs and had conveyor belts.
                There were enormous pots for smelting steel and a network of catwalks that connected everything in a web
                of rusting wrought iron.</p>

            <p>This warehouse came with benefits that the others did not. Because of the dangerous heavy machinery
                inside, the ceilings were supported by lead beams, and the walls were molded from high-density concrete.
                Here, government drones searching for electromagnetic signals or heat signatures would yield fruitless
                results. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, Solana's factory was as barren and lifeless as
                the rest of the district. Inside the warehouse, things were very different.</p>

            <p>On the third story, there were offices where labor managers and safety inspectors once observed the
                industrial work on the floor below. Those offices were home to Solana's sprawling technological network.
                State-of-the-art servers sat stacked next to one another, daisy-chained with loops of thick cables. They
                blinked with hundreds of green and blue lights, hinting at the terabytes of information flowing through
                her dark, echoing home.</p>

            <p>She pushed all the old desks together and stacked dozens of computer screens, each displaying a glimpse
                of the real world and the metaverse. There were news broadcasts, dashboards about her network, social
                media feeds about the latest DeFi/NFT projects, and multiple code editors. Solana wasn't going to risk
                missing a shred of information. Everything from geopolitical tensions to the number of transactions per
                second on her blockchain was worth analyzing.</p>

            <p>Nothing in the world happened in a vacuum; everything was tied together.</p>

            <p>She dragged a rolling computer chair across the concrete floors; its wheels were coming apart and
                rattling on its last legs. She spun it around so she could take a seat. As she settled in away from the
                intrusive eyes of a technological world monitored by government agencies, she felt safe enough to remove
                the holographic glyph she had managed to swipe from Ethereum's lab during his arrest.</p>

            <p>She held it in her hands as it floated there, slowly rotating in place, glowing as if it came from a
                simulated heaven of digital information. This was everything Ethereum had been working towards and why
                he had been arrested. She knew that something so powerful and sophisticated wouldn't be push-button
                easy. Nevertheless, she had to understand what it was and how she could crack it.</p>

            <p>She bit her bottom lip, reaching up to open the glyph with the hopes of getting a better look at the
                information stored inside. When the three-dimensional logo opened, it released a cloud of programming
                language that floated into the air like vapor. The lines of code arranged themselves in precise order,
                with everything carefully locked into place. The outer layers of code orbited the glyph like a hand-held
                galaxy of letters that were similar to yet different from DNA encryption.</p>

            <p>As she tilted her head one way and the other, furrowing her brow in a vain attempt to understand, she
                came to a slow realization. Whatever Ethereum was working on, whatever he had discovered, was beyond her
                understanding.</p>

            <p>That was no easy feat; Solana knew twelve programming languages. When she was a kid, she had learned C++
                before she could even speak English. Despite all her coding skills, she could not comprehend what she
                was looking at for the life of her.</p>

            <p>"It's brilliant," she whispered as she traced her fingers through the holographic display of code. "Or
                insane," she sighed, frustrated, and leaned back in her chair. "I guess it could be both."</p>

            <p>She found it annoying that potentially everything she had been working towards, a complete tear-down of
                the old system and the birth of a new one, was in her hands but undecipherable. The only person who knew
                what this computerized gibberish was supposed to say, or do, was Ethereum. Unfortunately, he was on an
                all-expenses-paid trip to a blacklisted detention cell.</p>

            <p>She decided to pursue her glyph research on Web3. While browsing, she saw the "Connect the Dots" online
                ad for a community event sponsored by a rival blockchain. Suddenly, Solana's eyebrows perked up as a
                thought occurred to her. She might not know what this code said, but that didn't mean nobody else
                did.</p>

            <p>Years ago, Solana remembered that Ethereum had worked closely with a hacker named Polkadot. The two never
                got along, but they had tried to get along, at least for a short while. Even though they notoriously
                argued all the time, it's impossible to argue about code if the other person doesn't know what you’re
                talking about.</p>

            <p>Polkadot didn't want to work with Ethereum on his project, probably because she didn't like it. However,
                if she didn't like it, she must have had a reason. Perhaps she might very well know how to read it. Just
                because she didn't like it didn't mean she didn't understand it; quite the contrary.</p>

            <p>It was a long shot, but it was Solana's only lead. However, it was slightly problematic that she had
                never met Polkadot before. It would have been easier to get into her Torrey Pines Estate undetected if
                she had been invited, but that didn't make it impossible. It just meant she would have to use more
                caution than usual.</p>

            <p>Solana waved her hand through the air, sifting her fingers through the floating cloud of holographic
                code, and summoned it back to the diamond-shaped casing. The logo sealed itself closed and trapped the
                mysterious language inside.</p>

            <p>Polkadot diversified her money in many asset classes around the world. The extent of her wealth was a
                complete mystery to both governments and corporations.</p>

            <p>The seemingly random ups and downs of finances were nothing more than an optical illusion to her. In the
                morning, she would sip coffee in her sterile white breakfast nook surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass
                windows and stare at a tablet of streaming stock market quotes. An intense day on the New York Stock
                Exchange could swing prices on the Shanghai Stock Exchange with rippling effects that would spill out on
                the Euronext Exchange.</p>

            <p>If she squinted her eyes just right to blur her vision, the red and green numbers would start to take
                shape, revealing swirling patterns resembling frequency wavelengths. By identifying the sweeping curves
                of information, Polkadot could see trends and patterns invisible to even the most intuitive
                stockbroker.</p>

            <p>Like a prescient analyst, she sensed when inflation would rise and when a global housing bubble would
                burst months beforehand. Her ability to recognize small yet significant details was uncanny. She could
                expertly shuffle her money away from pitfalls and collapses that would have left most people flat
                broke.</p>

            <p>Her transactions were nothing short of miraculous. When a seemingly worthless company would get scooped
                up by a mega-corporation, and their pitiful shares would suddenly skyrocket, Polkadot would predict the
                trend before it started and acquire a sizeable equity stake.</p>

            <p>Polkadot did not accumulate wealth because she needed it; she wasn't in the game for fame or money. She
                was in it for the raw numbers. She liked figuring them out, predicting what they might do, and, more
                than anything, being right.</p>

            <p>What Polkadot did not much care for was the sudden ring of her doorbell at 6:11 am, right before the US
                stock market opened on the East Coast.</p>

            <p>"How is that even possible?" she said to herself. She had a front-gated domain and a top-of-the-line
                security system with motion detectors leading to her doorstep. Still, the intruder had managed to dodge
                all the alarms and straight-up ring her doorbell.</p>

            <p>She hadn't bothered to change out of her outfit from the night before: a black velvet dress adorned with
                hundreds of tiny white polka dots. This attention-grabbing fashion statement caught the eye of all the
                coked-up stockbrokers who went out to the nightclubs. They would flash their money, get trashed on
                high-priced cocktails, and share material non-public information.</p>

            <p>She wasn't necessarily hung over, but she was in no mood to entertain guests. Glancing at stock charts on
                her tablet, she thought she could return her attention to trading and hoped the bothersome stranger on
                her porch would disappear. Shortly after she fixed her eyes on the screen, the doorbell rang again.</p>

            <p>With a groan, she rose to her feet and arched her back to stretch out – Might as well, if I'm going to be
                flipping standing, she thought to herself – as she made her way to the front entrance. It was a long
                walk through her palatial estate, past a library of books she would never read, through a parlor of
                furniture she had never touched, and to a front door of solid African blackwood.</p>

            <p>A loud clack came from the brass handles of the door, releasing the catch. Using both hands and putting
                all her 105 pounds of weight into it, Polkadot dragged the solid exotic slab open.</p>

            <p>A filthy hacker who looked exhausted and out of breath was standing on the porch, caught in the glorious
                light of a California sunrise. Polkadot tilted her head as she gave the intruding girl a sideways
                glance, almost sure she had seen her before.</p>

            <p>"Polkadot?" The uninvited visitor asked.</p>

            <p>Polkadot squinted as if she could see into the frequency of the hacker's life in an attempt to crack the
                code of her existence before anyone could say it out loud, but it didn't work. Her intuition was that
                the girl standing on her porch wasn't a run-of-the-mill hacker who had seen too many Hollywood
                movies.</p>

            <p>"Do I know you?" Polkadot asked.</p>

            <p>"I'm Solana," the girl said, introducing herself. "I'm… well, I'm not friends with Ethereum, but I know
                him. Knew him. Knew him or know him, I'm not too sure. The government has prosecuted him."</p>

            <p>Polkadot harumphed at the fate of Ethereum. She wasn't fond of the man and his wild, mad-scientist
                approach to numbers and code. She wasn't surprised that his hair-brained ideas had landed him on the
                receiving end of a government raid.</p>

            <p>"Being friends with Ethereum does not impress me," Polkadot said. "So, if you're looking for someone to
                help you free that crypto punk from government detention-"</p>

            <p>"I'm not," Solana said, interrupting. "That's not why I'm here. I'm here to show you this," Solana held
                out her cupped hands and offered up the holographic glyph that had eluded her genius. "This is what
                Ethereum was working on when he called me and what he was showing me when the government busted in and
                dragged him away. Whatever its meaning, it's dangerous enough to bring the Feds crashing down on
                everyone's heads."</p>

            <p>Polkadot took a cautious step back. "Oh, thank you so much for bringing it here."</p>

            <p>"I'll take it and leave," Solana said. "Just help me open it."</p>

            <p>"Me?" Polkadot asked. "Why me? I've never seen that thing before in my life."</p>

            <p>"No, but you've worked with Ethereum before," Solana said. "You're the only one who can figure out the
                complex coding language he came up with. It's all mixed up in this, and I'd be lucky if I could figure a
                single line out, let alone decode the whole thing."</p>

            <p>Polkadot frowned. She didn't want to code. She didn't want to help a stranger who unexpectedly showed up
                at her home on a random Thursday morning. And she certainly didn't want to go cracking open one of
                Ethereum's deranged projects.</p>

            <p>Solana could see the answer creeping up on Polkadot's face and spoke up before she could say no.</p>

            <p>"Please," Solana said. "I'm sorry for infiltrating your property, but you might be the only person able
                to decode this." She slid her hand into her pocket and fished out a handful of cash, a few
                hundred-dollar bills. "I'll pay you."</p>

            <p>Solana's hacking skills, mixed with her evident desperation, brought a smirk to Polkadot's face, followed
                by an involuntary laugh. A handful of cash was hilariously embarrassing to Polkadot, but she admired the
                gesture regardless of Solana's hopelessness.</p>

            <p>"Alright," Polkadot said. "You're funny. I like you." She stepped to the side and gestured for Solana to
                enter. "Let's look at what we're working with here."</p>

            <p>In the basement of Polkadot's Torrey Pines Estate was a clean, dark wine cellar replete with elegant and
                extravagant bottles of wine that would fetch a small fortune at an auction. Behind a rack of bottles in
                the furthest corner was a secret stairwell that descended even lower into the ground. This entrance was
                electronically sealed, and the maglocks would temporarily release if someone were to remove the bottle
                of 2004 Penfolds Block 42 Cabernet Sauvignon.</p>

            <p>Polkadot rarely brought people down to these lower levels where she kept her bleeding-edge computer tech.
                In fact, she could count the number of people who knew about this room on one hand.</p>

            <p>They stood in the glow of a dozen computer screens and stared in awe at Ethereum's glyph as it unpacked
                itself and released a cloud of holographic code floating into the air. Solana had experienced this
                before, but the strange yet fascinating piece of technology was no less breathtaking to admire.</p>

            <p>Polkadot, who had always been skeptical of Ethereum's wild inventions, saw the culmination of his life's
                work and was surprised to find herself impressed.</p>

            <p>"I've never seen anything like it," Polkadot said.</p>

            <p>"Can you understand it?" Solana asked. "Do you know what it does? Or what it's for?"</p>

            <p>Polkadot didn't respond immediately, but she thought she could decode it. After all, she'd worked with
                Ethereum in the past and had entertained his crackpot ideas on the interoperability of blockchains. She
                often tried to ignore him when he rambled about this or that for too long, but he was insistent. He was
                well known for repeating himself until he had been acknowledged.</p>

            <p>Despite her best efforts, some of Ethereum's theories wormed their way into her long-term memory, and as
                she closed her eyes, she thought she could recall just enough information to decode what was hidden
                inside the glyph.</p>

            <p>"This is all Federally related," Polkadot said, twirling her finger at a specific region of code that
                drifted past Solana's head.</p>

            <p>"Federal?" Solana asked. She stepped back and searched through the code but couldn't recognize what
                Polkadot was seeing. "You mean, like, the government?"</p>

            <p>"Not exactly," Polkadot said. She tilted her head and unfocused her eyes, trying to blur her vision and
                see deeper into the code. "It's not a government system; it's just designed to interact with the
                government system based on my understanding."</p>

            <p>Polkadot crossed her arms and stepped back as she huffed in frustration.</p>

            <p>"What?" Solana asked, "what's wrong?"</p>

            <p>"I can't make heads or tails of what this is trying to say," Polkadot replied. "It's not complete
                nonsense; it's got structure. The coding is tight, but many parts are incomprehensible despite my best
                efforts to read it. You and I might be good at what we do, but we have no hope of understanding what
                this glyph means."</p>

            <p>"You're saying Ethereum is insane," Solana asserted.</p>

            <p>"Eh, as the old saying goes," Polkadot replied. "The only difference between insanity and genius is
                success." She took another look at the code and nodded in slight approval. "Ethereum knew what he was
                doing. This code has a purpose." Polkadot threw up her hands, let them fall to her sides, and turned her
                eyes to Solana. "But we may never know if he's insane or a genius."</p>

            <p>Solana shook her head. "No, I'm not buying that. Ethereum got scooped up by the government for this,
                which means he was a threat. The government feared what he was working on. Whatever this is..." she
                said, twirling her finger at the holograms, "… it's the real deal."</p>

            <p>"Well," Polkadot said, "unless you know another genius programmer who moonlights as a rambling madman, I
                don't know how you're ever going to crack this thing."</p>

            <p>"I might not need a rambling madman to crack this," Solana said. "It's Federal code, isn't it?"</p>

            <p>Polkadot was skeptical of the direction this conversation was heading. She was hesitant to agree
                outright. "Sure…"</p>

            <p>Solana lowered her voice to a whisper, not that anyone else could overhear them in Polkadot's basement
                bunker. Still, her instinct was to lower her voice when invoking the authorities: "Then I'll convince a
                Fed to tell me what it is."</p>

            <p>Solana and Polkadot stood in silence, face to face, before Polkadot's mouth turned into a grin. She
                revealed her pearly white teeth, then began to laugh. After a moment of laughing – then realizing that
                Solana was unamused – she settled herself down and again became quiet.</p>

            <p>"Oh..." Polkadot said, "You're serious."</p>

            <p>"Oh, I'm serious," Solana said.</p>

            <p>"Well…" Polkadot raised her eyebrows and shook her head. "Then you're an idiot. If you show this to the
                Feds, they will wipe the glyph with an electromagnet and throw you in a dark, forgotten interrogation
                cell. That's the last anyone will ever see of you."</p>

            <p>"Avalanche knows people in the government," Solana said.</p>

            <p>"Oh, does he?" Polkadot asked skeptically. "And where did you hear that?"</p>

            <p>"Well," Solana paused. She knew the answer sounded dumb but continued anyway. "From Avalanche."</p>

            <p>"Solana, use your brain," Polkadot said. Her tone was of an older sister trying to talk some sense into a
                younger one. "Avalanche says all kinds of silly things."</p>

            <p>"I know," Solana said. "I know what Avalanche is like." She steeled herself and pointed forcefully at the
                orbiting holographic symbols. "But, as you said, the only person who can figure out what this means is a
                rambling madman or a Fed. The only rambling madman I know has already been arrested, so a Fed is the
                only option I have left."</p>

            <p>Polkadot sighed, pointed her eyes toward the floor, and shook her head in dismay. "I guess... If that's
                what you choose to do with your time." She looked up and pressed her finger against Solana's chest. "But
                whatever you do, from here on out, keep my name out of it."</p>

            <p>Solana had always been self-sufficient. From her time spent skulking through the corners of Web3,
                searching for loose strings of code to practice her illicit hacking skills, Solana had long ago learned
                that working alone, whenever possible, was the best. This way, there were fewer people to rat her out
                and, most importantly, fewer people who could learn about the warehouse that served as her base of
                operations.</p>

            <p>The government acted quickly to set up various arbitrary laws about how someone could or could not use
                digital currencies or how they could or could not use Web3. Those laws were written by ancient fossils
                who lived in estate mansions and could barely wrap their heads around the concept of a decentralized
                world, let alone how to enforce one.</p>

            <p>It all began when digital currencies started to threaten the Feds' greenback as the world's reserve
                currency due to their massive market capitalization. With the aging population and stagflation from
                decades of loose monetary policy, the youth preferred to live in the metaverse, leading to chronic
                unemployment. The Feds saw the need to protect its grasp on society from this disruptive innovation that
                had ushered in the era of digital repression.</p>

            <p>For these reasons, many laws were established, and the Feds brutally enforced them, even if they didn't
                understand them, even if no one understood them. With ever-increasing frequency, Solana's associates
                randomly disappeared, scooped up in the middle of the night by jack-booted thugs with Federal ID
                badges.</p>

            <p>Despite her vivid discussion with Polkadot, it pained her to have to once again turn to someone else for
                help. The pain was doubled, given that Avalanche was the only person who could help her.</p>

            <p>She knew Avalanche wouldn't work for free. He made that clear the last time they met; she knew it would
                not change. The data she was after had the Feds written all over it. It went without saying that no
                paltry sum of money would be sufficient.</p>

            <p>In preparation for their meeting, Solana strolled down the quietest side streets downtown, playing it
                cool but secretly checking her wireless frequency scanner for the least-secure ATMs. She wasn't going to
                steal physical money – the theft of physical money was painfully obvious and too easy to trace; instead,
                she would sweep up electronic transactions before they reached their financial institutions.</p>

            <p>Just passing within ten feet of an ATM was close enough for her bank account to divert the transactions
                like an electromagnet. She snapped up money from the electronic machines by the thousands. She repeated
                this process until she had enough to tempt Avalanche to use his Federal connections to decipher the
                strangest parts of Ethereum's code.</p>

            <p>Once she had triangulated a dozen downtown blocks and her disposable bank account was starting to nip at
                the heels of seven digits, she arrived at Nagasaki Gardens – a Japanese restaurant Avalanche often
                frequented. Although there was a slight chance he might have opted for something different for lunch,
                Solana knew she had struck gold when she saw his blacked-out Rolls Royce parked out front.</p>

            <p>Nagasaki Gardens was not a simple Japanese restaurant. It wasn't listed in any tourist guide of downtown
                hotspots. The prevailing rumor was that the Yakuza owned the restaurant, which explained its pristine
                exterior and extravagant décor. Solana needed to interrupt his lunch and speak with Avalanche, and she
                worried she might not be allowed in the front door dressed the way she was; she was not inclined to
                change into a slinky red dress and fancy high heels.</p>

            <p>Still, she stepped inside. Her eyes slowly adjusted from the blinding sunshine to the dim, ambient
                lighting, and when her vision cleared, she found a well-dressed maître d' smiling in front of her.
                Funny, she thought. She expected him to sneer and ask her to leave, not greet her with a menu in one
                hand and a cloth towel draped over his forearm.</p>

            <p>"Miss Solana," the man said softly and respectfully. "It is a pleasure to have you. Please, follow me. I
                will take you to your table."</p>

            <p>Solana's face scrunched in confusion. "Table?"</p>

            <p>The maître d’ did not respond. He turned and led her deeper into the restaurant, past individual booths
                separated by sheets of rice paper, bamboo-laden water features, and ornate silken changing screens.
                Inside was Avalanche – who came into view at the far end of the restaurant. Her gracious host led her to
                the table, placed the menu down by the empty seat directly opposite to Avalanche, and departed.</p>

            <p>Solana did not sit down right away. Instead, she shot a confused look at Avalanche, who was sitting
                behind a banquet of exquisite food: plates full of fresh sushi, slabs of bright pink and ruby-colored
                sashimi, accompanied by bowls of brown and red sauces. He had been waiting for her impatiently. A
                sizeable number of his entrees had been eaten, and the slick-haired hacker was enjoying a small
                porcelain cup of sake.</p>

            <p>Avalanche finished his sake, admired his work, then set it down on the tablecloth to give Solana his full
                attention. He gestured at the seat across from him.</p>

            <p>"Won't you join me?" he asked.</p>

            <p>"I suppose..." She reluctantly moved the seat out and sat down. Gathering herself, she leaned forward
                intently on her elbows and asked, "How did you know I was looking for you?"</p>

            <p>"Oh, I've been watching you," Avalanche replied. "Keeping an eye on… things."</p>

            <p>"So, then you know about this?" she asked, tugging aside her jacket, revealing the holographic glyph
                tucked inside.</p>

            <p>"I do," he replied.</p>

            <p>"And do you know about the lines of federal code in it?" she asked, eager to get the answers she had been
                searching for. "Do you know what it says? Do you know what it does?"</p>

            <p>Avalanche chuckled to himself. "I do know what it does."</p>

            <p>As if his tone wasn't suspicious enough, Solana's eyes perked up when she heard the familiar sound of
                tires screeching on the concrete outside. She shot to her feet, scanned the windows, and saw a platoon
                of black SUVs surround the building. Immediately aware of her betrayal, she whipped back to Avalanche,
                red-faced and furious.</p>

            <p>"A thousand apologies," Avalanche said, almost disinterested. He dipped his maki roll in a small bowl of
                soy sauce. "The Feds came to me first. They seem particularly interested in this little glyph of yours."
                He popped a piece of the maki roll in his mouth and with his mouth full said, "And they pay more."</p>

            <p>He gulped down his food and added with a wolfish grin, "Of course, for a hundred thousand USDC, I might
                be able to throw them off your scent for 60 seconds. The choice is yours, darling."</p>

            <p>Settled in the heart of downtown San Diego – sandwiched between a shop that sold vinyl records and a
                second-hand thrift store – was Epoch, a trendy café where the scent of freshly ground espresso beans
                lingered.</p>

            <p>Two baristas worked furiously behind the counter, one blasting steam into a tin mug of milk and the other
                taking customer orders on a tablet. The line wasn’t particularly long, but it was held up by a woman
                standing at the counter, meticulously weighing her coffee options. Her long red hair flowed from beneath
                a wide-brimmed hat. She wore a mid-length floral dress that showed her dark tights and stylish brown
                suede pumps.</p>

            <p>Terra, the woman, carefully pondering her order, would have been a billionaire in her own right had she
                not given her money to various charitable causes. She had invented a blockchain that hosted an
                algorithmic stablecoin designed to mimic the US dollar one-to-one. She had always been an idealistic
                daydreamer who thought that one day everyone on earth would have access to decentralized money that
                maintained its value.</p>

            <p>As was the case with many self-made entrepreneurs, Terra was notoriously eccentric. Very few civilians
                noticed her or knew who she was in person. After all, most hipsters in their late twenties were
                eccentric; no one expected anything less from a girl like her.</p>

            <p>"Twenty-ounce breve, please," Terra said as she zoned out while staring at the chalkboard menu. "With
                almond milk, cinnamon sprinkles on top, and one pump of coconut syrup, please. Hot, but not too hot, you
                know? And…" Her voice trailed off. She put her hand to her chin and tapped her bottom lip as she
                continued to weigh her options. "Gosh, I want chocolate too. I know this might sound crazy, but can you
                add chocolate to that? I’ll add one pump of dark chocolate syrup."</p>

            <p>The barista raised an eyebrow, smiled, and continued typing down her order, constantly adjusting to her
                various changes.</p>

            <p>Terra’s face suddenly lit up. "Oh my god," she mumbled to herself. "What time is it?"</p>

            <p>She furiously swung her vegan leather purse around her shoulder, opened it, and began digging for her
                phone. She pulled it out and activated the screen with her manicured fingertip.</p>

            <p>The time was 13:37.</p>

            <p>"Sweet Jesus," she muttered. Her eyes darted up towards the barista. "Nevermind. I have to run. Sorry.
                I’m super late!"</p>

            <p>And just like that, she turned, dashed out the front door, and sprinted down the sidewalk.</p>

            <p>"Shit, shit, shit," she repeated to herself as she hurried around the corner. "Don’t be late, don’t be
                late, don’t be la-"</p>

            <p>Terra stopped dead in her tracks as Nagasaki Gardens came into view. Sure enough, she had completely lost
                track of time, just as she feared. She got distracted by the cherry blossom trees on her way downtown,
                the squirrel who got close enough to almost pet, and the robust smell of roasted coffee emanating from
                Epoch.</p>

            <p>She had completely missed her appointment. The Feds swarmed outside the restaurant like an international
                raid on a drug cartel.</p>

            <p>But it wasn’t drugs the Feds were after.</p>

            <p>Solana had walked into an ambush set up by Avalanche and the government agents searching for Ethereum’s
                enigmatic glyph. Terra saw the street filled with black SUVs and a SWAT helicopter. Her shoulders
                slumped; she knew this government raid would happen. It was the only reason she had come downtown in the
                first place. She clenched her fists, stamped her foot on the concrete, and cursed herself for being so
                easily distracted.</p>

            <p>Alright, Terra thought in a convincing inner voice. You can still do this. You can think of a plan. She
                softly thumped her fist against her forehead. Come on, Terra, don’t be whimsical!</p>

            <p>Terra moved quickly up the sidewalk and towards the restaurant. Had she looked any more conspicuous and
                less like a fashion-conscious hipster, the Feds might have noticed her and deemed her out of place.
                Luckily, she was able to scurry down a nearby alleyway unnoticed.</p>

            <p>Ethereum had prepared her for this eventuality, for which she would have to be constantly on the lookout.
                "I’m asking Solana to meet with me," he had told her over a secure, encrypted voicemail to which only
                she had access. That was the last time they communicated before the government snatched him up. "I’m
                going to show her the glyph. If anything happens to me, I need you to keep an eye on her."</p>

            <p>Terra hated letting the old man down, but she hadn’t failed yet. Technically, Solana was still inside the
                restaurant, un-arrested, with a small window of opportunity to run from the Feds. It wouldn’t be easy or
                a graceful escape, but they could do it if they worked together.</p>

            <p>She reached the back entrance of Nagasaki Gardens just as the door burst open, and Solana came rushing
                out. The two women nearly ran into each other, and the collision was avoided only due to Solana’s quick
                reflexes. Solana grabbed Terra by the shoulders and spun her out of the way without thinking.</p>

            <p>From around the corner of the building, they both heard commanding shouts. The Feds kicked in the front
                door and invaded the place, searching for Solana and the glyph. There was only a mere sixty seconds
                before the cryptocurrency Solana had hastily paid Avalanche to keep his mouth shut would run out, and he
                would rat out her deft escape.</p>

            <p>"We have to go!" Terra whisper-shouted as she grabbed Solana by the arm. She scampered down the alleyway,
                tugging the panicked hacker along behind her. Solana had a hundred questions but knew she had to escape
                first and hesitated for just a moment before deciding to let the unfamiliar hipster lead the way.</p>

            <p>"Who are you?" Solana asked as they ran.</p>

            <p>"A friend of Ethereum’s," Terra replied. "And a…" Her voice trailed off, and her pace slowed to a halt.
                Her eyes wandered up towards the sky. "Ooh, wow, did you see that cloud? It looks like a cat!"</p>

            <p>"Come on!" Solana snapped, now in front and the one doing the dragging. "Fuck the clouds."</p>

            <p>Terra snapped out of her distracted state and returned to a full-speed sprint alongside Solana, but not
                without a quick aside: "You shouldn’t say, ‘Fuck the clouds.’ That’s rude."</p>

            <p>Solana and her new friend – though she was hesitant to use that word on a stranger – sprinted through the
                alleyways of San Diego. Solana handled the corners easily; she lived half-expecting to break into a
                sprint at any moment and was always careful to wear footwear with good traction.</p>

            <p>Terra, on the other hand, was not forward-thinking enough to wear anything better suited for the cracked,
                lop-sided concrete than a pair of brown suede pumps. The red-haired hipster did her best to keep up with
                Solana, but she could neither match the hacker's speed nor hook around the corners quickly.</p>

            <p>As they dashed through the alleyways, they caught occasional glimpses of glossy, black SUVs speeding down
                the side streets in an attempt to confine a search perimeter. Red and blue lights flashed from inside
                their tinted windshields, and sirens blared into the sky, echoing through the city and could undoubtedly
                be heard as far as the neighborhood of La Jolla.</p>

            <p>"We're not going to outrun the Feds," Terra said, nearly out of breath, desperately trying to keep up
                with Solana. "They're all over the place. Where are we going to go?"</p>

            <p>Solana stopped and took a moment to scout both left and right. Her new associate was right. The Feds were
                out in full force, swarming the area and probably locking the city down in a five-block radius. They
                weren't going to get away on foot, and trying to steal a car was straight-up suicide.</p>

            <p>But Terra had spotted an alternative. Despite their dire situation, she was no less inclined to moments
                of distraction, and her eyes wandered to something above them. The pair stood at the backside of an
                apartment building, and bolted to the wall, eight feet up and just barely out of reach, was a steel
                emergency ladder.</p>

            <p>"Maybe we go up?" Terra suggested.</p>

            <p>"Here," Solana said to Terra as she backed up against the brick wall. She motioned for her to follow,
                then glanced up at the ladder. "Give me a boost."</p>

            <p>"Alright," Terra said as she hurried over to Solana. "A… boost?" She gave her open hands a confused look.
                She knew, deep down, that any self-respecting adult would know how to give a boost. However, her
                experiences in her free time were limited to playing violin in the park and reading books with small,
                easy words. "Okay, how exactly does one 'give a boost'?"</p>

            <p>"Oh, my God," Solana muttered. She took Terra's wrists, put the girl’s hands together with interlocking
                fingers, and moved them to a proper position off the ground. Satisfied with her work, she looked at the
                airheaded girl and spoke clearly. "Stay like this. I'll step here." She raised her foot and placed it in
                Terra's hands. "Then, you help boost me up to that ladder."</p>

            <p>Terra nodded eagerly, excited at how simple the instructions were. "Okay, let's do it."</p>

            <p>All Terra had to do was lift, and she did it perfectly. Solana stepped off the ground, Terra hoisted her
                up, and with two metallic thumps, Solana grabbed onto the ladder's bottom rung. She was no stranger to
                climbing (or running or hiding, for that matter) and quickly scaled the ladder. Once she was securely in
                place, she clicked the safety release.</p>

            <p>The ladder dropped six feet and slammed into another locked position with a resonating metallic bang that
                would certainly have been audible on the streets if the sirens and alarms didn't drown it out. Solana
                was nearly knocked loose by the sudden stop of the ladder but managed to hang on tight.</p>

            <p>Together, Solana and Terra scurried up the ladder and emerged into the blazing sunlight of the San Diego
                rooftops. The alleyways weren't that much darker, but the two women had to squint against the bright,
                unobscured sun.</p>

            <p>"Let's go," Solana said, breaking into a sprint across the rooftop. She maneuvered around various vents
                that protruded from the roof and weaved left and right through thrumming air conditioners.</p>

            <p>"Wait up!" Terra called out after her. She was doing her best to keep pace, but the rooftop was uneven,
                and the obstacles made it challenging for her to move around.</p>

            <p>"Kick your shoes off!" Solana called back over her shoulder.</p>

            <p>"Kick my shoes off?" Terra repeated. "Are you crazy? These are nine-hundred-dollar pumps. I got these in
                Paris!"</p>

            <p>"I'll buy you new ones!" Solana replied. "I'll buy you ten new ones. Just hurry up!"</p>

            <p>Terra huffed but was sharp enough to realize it wasn't the best time to argue. She angrily inserted her
                index finger through the ankle straps of her shoes and slipped them loose. With the heels left lying on
                the rooftop, she proceeded forward barefoot.</p>

            <p>She took a moment to turn back to her black shoes, resting there abandoned, and silently mouthed the
                words, "I’m sorry."</p>

            <p>"Let’s go," Solana snapped.</p>

            <p>The duo dashed along the length of the apartment roof, then leaped over the alleyway to the neighboring
                building. Solana’s landing was athletic, with deft feet and a professional slide to a stop. Terra
                followed, waving her arms and legs through the air in a panic, and crashed to the next rooftop in a
                heap.</p>

            <p>"You’re new to this," Solana said as she helped Terra to her feet.</p>

            <p>"I don’t even know what ‘this’ is," Terra replied, brushing her hair out of her eyes.</p>

            <p>As Terra stumbled forward and Solana helped her along, the wind began to pick up speed until it was
                whipping all around them. Their hair blew around in the strong gusts, and their clothes fluttered.</p>

            <p>Then came the distinctive sound of rotating helicopter blades. Solana and Terra looked up to see a black
                military aircraft descend from the sky and lower itself near their position. They could barely make out
                the pilot through the heavily tinted glass, and the sliding side door opened to reveal two men wielding
                heavy assault rifles pointed at them.</p>

            <p>"Aw, shit," Solana muttered. "Run!"</p>

            <p>Solana and Terra bolted away. The metallic chatter of machine-gun fire rattled off and echoed across the
                neighborhood. Out of instinct, Solana threw her hands over her head and ran with her eyes closed. She
                could hear the bullets thump against the rooftop all around her.</p>

            <p>Her foot clipped the edge of the apartment building, and she went tumbling face-first over the edge. She
                dropped ten stories straight down. Her body smashed through the plastic lids of a recycling bin and
                thumped hard against four feet of cardboard and Styrofoam. The landing wasn’t graceful, and she was sure
                she had bruised her bottom ribs, but she was alive.</p>

            <p>And that was all that mattered.</p>

            <p>She rolled her head to the side to check on her new associate, Terra. She had also crashed into the same
                recycling bin, but she laid there with her eyes open. A trickle of blood dripped from the corner of her
                mouth. Panicked about the extent of the girl’s injuries, Solana forced herself to her knees, wincing
                against the sharp pain in her ribcage, and rolled Terra onto her back.</p>

            <p>Terra, who might have easily survived the fall from the edge of the building, certainly would not recover
                from the five high-density impact bullet holes lodged in her abdomen.</p>

            <p>Despite her mortal wounds, the girl’s face still had a fixed expression of wonder, as if something
                incredible had once again caught her attention just before she exhaled her last breath.</p>

            <p>Solana’s shoulders slumped. She hadn’t known her sidekick for more than twenty minutes, and she was
                already dead.</p>

            <p>The Feds didn’t afford her any time to process her situation or the loss of her new friend. Within
                seconds, a dozen agents in full tactical gear swarmed the recycling bin, assault weapons at the ready,
                and pointed at Solana’s head.</p>

            <p>Solana was finally cornered and, with nowhere left to run, had no choice but to put her hands in the
                air.</p>

            <p>"Here."</p>

            <p>The guard snorted as he slid the food tray into the tiny slit on the bottom of the heavy-duty cell door.
                The tray contained an unsettling bland mash and a complimentary fruit juice to the side. Solana turned
                her head in disgust.</p>

            <p>"Suit yourself."</p>

            <p>Solana huddled up in one of the corners of the four drab walls that enclosed her. She felt alone. Her
                thoughts relentlessly fluttered in her mind as she questioned her decisions.</p>

            <p>Where did it all go wrong? What could I have done differently to save Terra's life? Why couldn't I just
                have been a law-abiding citizen like everyone else? Why did I agree to help this madman?</p>

            <p>"Sir! Sh-she's not the most compliant, sir," the guard stammered from the other side of the wall.</p>

            <p>As if she could visualize the smirk on the man's face, Solana heard a confident, "We'll see about
                that."</p>

            <p>The clicks and clanks of the cell door echoed through the room, and Solana anticipated the man she
                assumed was coming.</p>

            <p>Her intuition was right.</p>

            <p>The door creaked wide open. Solana scanned the recently polished patent leather shoes to the black
                military suit she had seen. It was none other than the man known as J. Powell.</p>

            <p>"Solana, my darling, how are we?" Powell glanced at the untouched food tray. "Not eating too well? Can't
                say I blame you. They don't serve the best meals here."</p>

            <p>"Whatever it is you're offering, I don't have what you need," Solana snapped. She avoided eye contact
                with him. Even if she knew, she wouldn't have given him anything.</p>

            <p>"Ah, so naïve. Just tell me. What do you gain from helping Ethereum? Don't lie to me; I know you work for
                him. Just like the poor lass who met such an unfortunate fate."</p>

            <p>Solana held back her tears the best she could. She thought about that clumsy redhead with the
                nine-hundred-dollar heels. She wished she could have gotten out of this mess to buy the ten pairs of
                heels she'd promised. Her attention quickly shifted to Powell's hand, which held the elusive glyph. It
                hovered rhythmically; its strange ebb and flow was as mysterious as its contents.</p>

            <p>"I told you, I don't have what-" Solana repeated.</p>

            <p>"Stop deflecting my question and answer me. What did Ethereum offer you? It can't be money because you
                didn't have the funds to keep Avalanche from selling you out. Fame? No. Even Polkadot didn't know who
                you were, and she's well entrenched in the city's socialite circle," Powell remarked with an all-knowing
                grin. He brushed the lint from his shoulder. "That's right, Solana. The government oversees everything.
                So tell me, what-"</p>

            <p>That was it. Solana closed her eyes and lost herself in her thoughts as she experienced a sense of
                revelation. It dawned on her.</p>

            <p>Solana recalled the time she sat atop the roof of the Symphony Towers. It was once a reputable hotel,
                foreclosed only to become an abandoned site for unending electronic billboards and tailored
                advertisements for human consumption. She looked over the vast cityscape of the San Diego night.</p>

            <p>Ethereum leaned on the ledge where Solana sat. The stillness was serene. It contrasted with the
                overcrowded virtual realms where people drowned their sorrows through the metaverse. Ethereum sometimes
                dubbed it the "metascape" as it was a literal "escape" from real-world society and its problems.</p>

            <p>"What are you thinking?" Ethereum broke the silence.</p>

            <p>Solana glanced at him but remained fixated on the magnificent night sky. "Have you ever wondered how the
                stars genuinely seem so freeform and lively, yet we dwell on artificial things?"</p>

            <p>"Not that I recall," Ethereum chuckled. "Is that why you're always moping about up here? You wanna be
                part of the stars, eh?"</p>

            <p>Solana did not budge at the man's jest.</p>

            <p>"Maybe… Our world is filled with false promises and fake freedom. It's not a choice. It's what they
                manipulate us to do. Why do you think we're all so consumed with such insignificant things?" Solana
                responded. She was getting a bit riled up for such a late evening. Ethereum laughed, amused at her
                words.</p>

            <p>"You're not incorrect there," Ethereum nodded. "This is exactly the reason why I rely on your insight.
                Soon, Solana, the world will change. I need you to be prepared for it."</p>

            <p>Those memories vanished with the snap of a finger.</p>

            <p>"Broken already? I haven't even started," Powell said and continued, "So, how do you open this piece of
                technology?"</p>

            <p>"Maybe you oughta just give it up," Solana suggested with a sarcastic tone.</p>

            <p>"Watch it, girl! You have no idea what I'm capable of!"</p>

            <p>Powell checked his watch. Impatiently, the man stuck his head out into the hall and shouted at the two
                nearby guards. "What's with the damn hold up! Bring him in already!"</p>

            <p>Solana feared the worst.</p>

            <p>She could hear the dragging chains from outside her cell. Solana clenched her fist. Ethereum, escorted by
                two guards, their arms tightly wrapped around his shoulders, was on his knees. Despite the bruises and
                cuts on his face, Ethereum smiled weakly.</p>

            <p>"Solana," Ethereum muttered.</p>

            <p>"Eth-!" Solana stood up as two more guards made their way but froze as they pointed rifles at her.</p>

            <p>A part of her felt relief that he was alive, but seeing him in such a state made her quiver with
                terror.</p>

            <p>Powell warned, "You don't want to overstep."</p>

            <p>Ethereum, with both wrists and ankles shackled, was barely recognizable. The swelling in his right eye
                almost made his face indistinguishable if it were not for his familiar grin that made most intellectuals
                question their most deep-rooted theories.</p>

            <p>"You think these fools would get rid of me yet?" Ethereum laughed weakly.</p>

            <p>With a swift motion, one of the guards summoned his expandable baton and violently smashed it against
                Ethereum's face, knocking him to the ground.</p>

            <p>"That's enough!" Solana called out. She could not bear to see Ethereum being physically abused while
                helpless.</p>

            <p>Powell held up his left hand, saving the man from further beating. "So then, either you tell me how to
                open this damn thing, or Ethereum… dies. Very simple."</p>

            <p>"I-I don't know. It's uncrackable. You would kill the only man that knows this programing language, and
                that's it. You will never crack it," Solana said. "Not in your lifetime."</p>

            <p>Powell released a deep sigh and closed his eyes with a faint smirk. "All right, Ethereum, I won't repeat
                it twice: either you crack this damned glyph, or Solana will be executed in front of you."</p>

            <p>"OK, I’ll crack it, but you must bring us to a state-of-the-art research lab with the equipment I need,"
                Ethereum responded. Solana looked at him with her eyes wide in disbelief.</p>

            <p>As the automatic doors opened, Solana was given a firm shove forward. She stood in awe; the government
                research lab was miles ahead of any technological facility she had ever seen.</p>

            <p>The modern room was immaculate and equipped with specialized military-grade equipment. Solana quickly
                scanned a vast network of supercomputers of an unfamiliar brand.</p>

            <p>She then glanced to the right, where Ethereum stood next to her, stoic and unamused. The blood on the
                side of his forehead had coagulated and ceased its descent to his chin.</p>

            <p>As they walked into the room, Solana wondered what Ethereum was thinking. Why would he unlock the glyph
                for them? she thought. Why did he spend years making it only to give up its secrets?</p>

            <p>Solana did not understand the man's plans, but it seemed that Powell's threat to kill her was a simple
                yet effective intimidation tactic. His decision to cooperate with the Fed angered her.</p>

            <p>A group of software engineers in white lab coats made their way over and surrounded Solana and Ethereum.
                Solana noticed a hungry look as they stared intently at the glyph.</p>

            <p>"We're ready to begin," the lead engineer said to Powell.</p>

            <p>Powell turned directly to Ethereum. "All the resources you requested are at your disposal. Open the
                glyph."</p>

            <p>"I will," Ethereum assured him. "But you have to take the cuffs off Solana first."</p>

            <p>Powell's face turned a shade of red. "There's no chance in hell," he spat.</p>

            <p>"If you want the glyph open, you'll do it," Ethereum almost smiled. "There's a multi-signature built into
                the glyph. It requires two people to open it. Your engineers have no idea what they're doing. Solana
                does. Take the cuffs off her, and we'll open the glyph."</p>

            <p>Powell stared at Ethereum, outraged.</p>

            <p>"Or don't," Ethereum shrugged. "It's up to you. I can wait."</p>

            <p>For a moment, Solana was sure that Powell would rather kill her than comply with Ethereum's request. But
                to her surprise, he nodded at the guard next to her. A thin silver key was fitted into the lock of her
                cuffs, and the shackles popped open with a twist. Solana pulled her hands free, staring at Ethereum.</p>

            <p>"You have what you want," Powell said. "Now open this fucking glyph."</p>

            <p>Powell handed the glyph to the lead engineer. He palmed the object with the utmost consideration, looking
                as mesmerized by this technology as if he had just received a newborn child.</p>

            <p>"What computers are these?" Ethereum asked, studying the machines that had caught Solana's attention
                earlier on.</p>

            <p>"The AES 512," Powell replied with a hint of boastful pride in his voice. "It's a top-of-the-line network
                of supercomputers, the best there is. So, you have no excuse not to open the glyph."</p>

            <p>Solana walked next to Ethereum as they followed the group of engineers forward.</p>

            <p>"What are you doing?" she hissed in a whisper.</p>

            <p>"Relax," Ethereum smiled. "Everything's going according to plan."</p>

            <p>"According to plan?" Solana repeated, incredulous. "What plan? We're trapped in a government facility
                with maybe a hundred guards. And you're saying that's part of your plan?"</p>

            <p>Ethereum turned to her and winked.</p>

            <p>At the center stood a decryption chamber. Cords stemmed from the bottom and hooked into the room's
                network of AES 512 supercomputers. As the lead engineer approached the apparatus, the glass visor of the
                chamber unlocked with a click and slid open.</p>

            <p>After placing the glyph inside, the engineer backed away. The visor slid closed and, with another click,
                locked into place.</p>

            <p>"Good to go!" the lead engineer nodded.</p>

            <p>A few clicks followed a soft whirring sound as the chamber booted up. Green light illuminated the inside,
                and Solana could see the glyph hovering in suspension behind the glass.</p>

            <p>"Ethereum, it's your turn," Powell said. He lifted his gun and pointed it at Solana, who froze in place
                at the sight of it.</p>

            <p>"There's a password after the multi-signature step," Powell continued. "So don't play any games. What is
                it?"</p>

            <p>"Solana," Ethereum said, ignoring Powell's question. "Go to the computer there." He nodded at a place to
                her left. She glanced at Powell, her eyes locked on the gun barrel.</p>

            <p>"Do it," Powell ordered.</p>

            <p>She stepped over to the computer with Ethereum hot on her heels. His fingers moved quickly over the keys
                next to her until a small black box popped up on her monitor screen.</p>

            <p>"The password," Powell barked. "What it is?"</p>

            <p>Ethereum grinned. "H3ll0 w0RlD!</p>

            <p>Inside the chamber, the glyph began to spin rapidly. A flash of brilliant green light irradiated from
                within, and Solana raised a hand to shield her eyes. Static electricity flew in every direction. Another
                wave of light burst and the servers around her went dark.</p>

            <p>"What's going on!?" she whispered as a siren began to blast. At that moment, the room went completely
                black.</p>

            <p>"An EMP," Ethereum whispered in her ear. "The glyph was designed to release an electromagnetic pulse at
                the passcode. Come on; we only have a few minutes to get out of here."</p>

            <p>Grabbing her hand, he pulled her, weaving around guards and engineers who stood fumbling through the
                blackout.</p>

            <p>"Ethereum, you piece of shit," Powell cursed. "What have you done? Engineers, go activate the
                generators!"</p>

            <p>Solana let Ethereum lead the way. The halls were dark, and Solana would have been lost if not for his
                sure footing.</p>

            <p>"Ethereum, what's happening? What did you do?"</p>

            <p>She could hear the glee in his voice as he spoke. "The glyph is a sophisticated malware I programmed,
                Solana," he explained. "It's designed to attack high redundancy storage and mirror data centers by
                corrupting the data through SQL code injection."</p>

            <p>"Wait," Solana said, pulling him. "What are you saying?"</p>

            <p>"The Fed's central bank is connected to most of the world's financial institutions. It's being
                decentralized as we speak. Most asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies, will
                be unaccounted for. The current global banking system as we know it has just been rendered useless. Do
                you know what this means?"</p>

            <p>"Cryptocurrencies and digital assets will be the only legitimate form of currency for the future!" she
                proclaimed.</p>

            <p>Ethereum nodded. "Exactly."</p>

            <p>One by one, the lights overhead sprang to life.</p>

            <p>"Shit," Ethereum muttered. "They must have gotten the generators up and running. Come on. We need to
                go."</p>

            <p>Solana and Ethereum rushed through the halls as the blinking fluorescent light exposed the two convicts.
                The sounds of racing footsteps echoed behind them, along with the faint crackle of a radio. Despite his
                initial lead, Ethereum was starting to lag.</p>

            <p>"Hurry, Ethereum!" Solana dashed forward.</p>

            <p>"I'm trying! It's my legs!" Ethereum responded. The physical injuries suffered in the Feds' custody were
                weighing on him. Each movement exerted a toll on his body. Ethereum would have been limping if not for
                the adrenaline rush.</p>

            <p>"Get those fucks!" Powell's voice shouted in the hallway, where the red lights in each upper corner of
                the walls blinked in tandem with the siren. Three SWAT soldiers rushed past Powell and aimed at the two
                escapees.</p>

            <p>Solana grabbed Ethereum and swiftly made a left turn. The sound of gunfire rang out as bullets hit the
                corner of the room. Ethereum shielded his face as chunks of cement went flying.</p>

            <p>One of the soldiers pressed his finger against his wireless earpiece. "East wing. Two inmates. Lock it
                down."</p>

            <p>Solana glanced down the hall and assessed the situation. She noticed several SWAT soldiers running toward
                them.</p>

            <p>"This way!" Ethereum darted in the direction of a nearby flight of stairs. She followed him without
                question.</p>

            <p>Solana and Ethereum spiraled down the long stairway one floor after another. Bullets rattled and
                ricocheted throughout the railings as they made their descent. Solana dared not look back this time.
                They both ducked instinctively with every barrage of gunfire and raced down as fast as they could.</p>

            <p>The federal facility was like a maze, but the time Ethereum spent analyzing it proved its worth, as he
                had managed to obtain the facility's blueprint and memorized an escape route.</p>

            <p>"We're almost to the ground floor… Turn right and open the first door!" Ethereum ordered.</p>

            <p>Solana wiggled the doorknob, but it was shut tightly. She rammed her left shoulder at the door but to no
                avail.</p>

            <p>"Move outta the way!" Ethereum threw his shoulder into the door with a violent jolt, and it burst
                open.</p>

            <p>Slamming the door shut, Ethereum closed the latch and braced himself against the solid metal door. They
                stood inside the confines of what appeared to be an administration office.</p>

            <p>"Get me something to hold this door," he shouted.</p>

            <p>Ignoring the wild beating of her heart, Solana scanned the room for something heavy. Next to them stood a
                series of desks and rolling chairs. She raced to the nearest desk and began to push.</p>

            <p>With an ear-splitting screech, the desk slid across the floor, Solana pushing against it with all her
                might. As the desk's far edge reached the door, Ethereum ducked beneath it, crawling through the space
                below to get to the other side. He gripped the same edge as Solana and shoved the desk hard into
                place.</p>

            <p>Together they pushed two more stainless steel desks against the door. "That should hold them for a minute
                or two," Ethereum breathed heavily, wiping the sweat from his brow.</p>

            <p>"Great, except we're trapped," Solana muttered. Ethereum took a moment to examine their surroundings
                before pointing at another desk near the corner of the room.</p>

            <p>"Are we?" he replied with a smirk, clearly hatching a plan. Solana followed his gaze to discover a large
                vent cover.</p>

            <p>The duo made their way over to the vent without a word. Ethereum climbed onto the desk, reaching up and
                slipping his fingers through the space between the cover and the vent. With a few quick tugs, he managed
                to pull down the vent cover.</p>

            <p>She placed her feet firmly against his thigh, her fingers struggling to grip the lip of the vent. In one
                smooth motion, he lifted her through the air, boosting her into the duct as the rhythmic pounding
                continued on the door outside.</p>

            <p>Once inside the duct, Solana reached back out and grabbed Ethereum's hand. With a groan, she helped pull
                him inside just as the door broke open. Ethereum pulled his legs up, but not before the SWAT soldiers
                spotted their clumsy escape.</p>

            <p>The soldiers opened fire on the ducts as Solana and Ethereum scrambled from one room to the next. As the
                sound of ricocheting bullets died behind them, Solana stopped. Another vent opening could be seen up
                ahead. She crawled up to it and peered through the slits in the cover. The room below was dark, but she
                could see several piles of boxes stacked up high.</p>

            <p>"Looks like some kind of storage room," she said, waving Ethereum forward to get a better look.</p>

            <p>"The sooner we get out of these ducts, the sooner we can get out of this place," he nodded. Solana gave
                the cover a hard shove; It popped free. She forced her legs through, dropping to the ground. Ethereum
                was quick to follow, and the pair crouched low.</p>

            <p>Two SWAT soldiers entered the room before they moved towards the door. The light from their rifles swept
                over their surroundings. Ethereum whispered to Solana that he would go to the right while she would go
                left and surreptitiously assault them.</p>

            <p>"Storage room is clear," one of the SWAT soldiers announced over the radio. Ethereum crept up behind him,
                grabbed the man's jaw, and twisted it violently. The crack of the soldier's neck reverberated in the
                room, and his body crumpled to the floor. Ethereum grabbed the rifle from the man's shoulder.</p>

            <p>Solana attempted the same maneuver on the other SWAT soldier but without success, as he was bigger and
                stronger than her. The man was able to pull a knife and plunge it into Solana's stomach. In the
                following motion, he quickly shoved her against the wall.</p>

            <p>He then turned to fight Ethereum only to receive his partner's stainless-steel rifle across his cheek.
                The SWAT soldier dropped unconscious almost instantly.</p>

            <p>Searing heat filled Solana's abdomen. She grunted, reaching down to feel a slick puddle of blood smearing
                her shirt. As the soldier's body fell to the floor, Ethereum raced to her side.</p>

            <p>"Solana… Are you okay?"</p>

            <p>"I…I got stabbed," Solana panted, her breathing shallow and ragged. She sagged into his arms, cradling
                her front as he rolled her so he could look at the extent of her wound.</p>

            <p>"Shit," he whispered.</p>

            <p>"You… You gotta go. I'll catch up," she said.</p>

            <p>"Like fuck you will. I'm not leaving you here." Ethereum spat. He placed Solana's arm around his neck to
                support her, and together they limped toward the nearby loading dock.</p>

            <p>"Hang in there. We're out," Ethereum promised as he made it out of the facility and into the welcoming
                city's street.</p>

            <p>"Hang on, Solana. We're almost there."</p>

            <p>Ethereum stared down softly at Solana as he cradled her in his arms. Despite her assurances that she was
                okay, he could see the pained expression on her face. Solana moaned as he applied pressure to the wound
                to stop the bleeding.</p>

            <p>"Maybe we should take her to a hospital?" the cab driver asked. He peeped back at Ethereum and Solana's
                pale faces from his rearview mirror. His dark eyes were full of worry.</p>

            <p>"This is not an option. The closest hospital is across the city. She'll never make it. Now, please mind
                your business, drive to my destination, and I'll tip you well," Ethereum snapped.</p>

            <p>"Shh," he whispered to Solana. "We're very close now."</p>

            <p>The cab pulled to a stop in a secluded alley. Tall brick walls and steel doors greeted them, a cold
                industrial landscape that Ethereum was all too familiar with.</p>

            <p>Shuffling Solana into his arms, he exited the cab and made his way down the alley. He waited for the cab
                to disappear, and when he was sure it was out of sight, he made his way to his hideout.</p>

            <p>The last steel door on the left looked like all the others, but behind it was an extensive laboratory.
                Ethereum had set the door with intricate digital locks, and he hurried to open them. Once inside, he
                carefully laid Solana down on a cot.</p>

            <p>Solana glanced around the room, wincing with each breath. "This place is incredible," she said, searching
                for anything to distract her from the pain. A series of high-tech computers stared back at her. But what
                drew her eye was a robot next to a chair. It had a series of tubes and cords that hooked into a nearby
                computer.</p>

            <p>"What's that for?" she asked, nodding in the robot's direction.</p>

            <p>Ethereum sank to his knees next to her, trembling fingers sliding her shirt over her wound. She gasped as
                the heat seared through her abdomen, followed by a sharp jolt of pain.</p>

            <p>"This is bad, Solana," he muttered, reaching for a pack below the cot. Inside was a variety of clothes he
                had packed away, along with a few medical supplies. Pulling out gauze and alcohol, he forced her to lay
                back as he began to disinfect the wound.</p>

            <p>"Tell me about the robot," Solana insisted, closing her eyes. She could feel her heart struggling to keep
                up with the massive amount of blood she was losing, but a calm sense of acceptance began to settle over
                her as she realized her fate.</p>

            <p>"It is designed to transfer consciousness to the metaverse," Ethereum explained as he worked. He balled
                up some gauze and pressed it tight against her wound to stop the bleeding. Solana had expected to feel
                pain, but to her surprise, there was none.</p>

            <p>"His name is Polygon," Ethereum continued, absentmindedly chatting as he tried to figure out how to save
                her.</p>

            <p>"Not the metaverse," Solana whispered. "I'll never understand what you see in it. We live in a world
                worth fighting for. Someplace tangible. I still believe we can redeem this world."</p>

            <p>She sucked in a deep, shuddering breath.</p>

            <p>"The metaverse is capable of so much more than our world, Solana," Ethereum insisted. "How can we agree
                on so many other things but not this? If only you accepted the metaverse —"</p>

            <p>"No," she whispered, shaking her head. "That's the last thing I would ever do. It isn't real, Ethereum. I
                don't want to live in a world that isn't —". Solana suddenly fell unconscious.</p>

            <p>"Fuck," he whispered. "I don't have much time left."</p>

            <p>He watched her, hoping she could hear him. "You're dying, Solana. And I don't think I can save you. At
                least not your body."</p>

            <p>He glanced toward the corner chair with the robot and made up his mind instantly. Lifting Solana back
                into his arms, he gently carried her to the chair and laid her down.</p>

            <p>Booting up the computer, he raced to attach the cords to Solana's still frame. Some were meant to track
                her vital signs: her temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen.</p>

            <p>But there was one step he couldn't take alone.</p>

            <p>Fingers tapping on the keyboard, he enlisted the help of Polygon. It drilled through Solana's skull and
                wended its way up the brainstem to capture the electrical pulses of the mind. From there, it would
                transfer those impulses and data to the computer, and Ethereum could proceed to send her to the
                metaverse.</p>

            <p>Ethereum worked quickly, sifting through window after window with her details so he could capture her
                consciousness. At last, the network was ready to accept her, and he made his way behind her chair to
                where Polygon stood waiting.</p>

            <p>Powering up Polygon, he watched as it made a soft yet low-pitched whirring sound. Extending upward from
                its base, which remained on the floor, a small needle emerged from Polygon's cylindrical casing. Moments
                later, it thrust upward, inserting itself into Solana's neck at the base of her brainstem.</p>

            <p>Ethereum glanced over at the computer, his heart racing as he monitored her vitals. To his relief, they
                remained stable, even as Polygon's fine needle was injected into her brain.</p>

            <p>Images began to flash on the screen. They were snippets of memories, sensations, and feelings. A steady
                stream of information flowed from her mind to his computer as Ethereum began to move her consciousness
                into the metaverse.</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry, Solana," he whispered as he watched the upload process of her thoughts disappear into endless
                strings of code. "I know this isn't what you wanted. But it was the only way I could save you. I hope
                one day you'll forgive me."</p>

            <p>Solana's eyes fluttered open as dim light slipped over the windowsill. For a moment, she lay there,
                wondering how she had gotten back in her bed. Was it all a dream? Propping herself up, she meticulously
                inspected her room as she tried to recall the events of the night before. She had been stabbed. She
                remembered it vividly. But when she lifted her shirt, there was no wound.</p>

            <p>"How long was I out?" she murmured, trying to wrap her head around it all. Shirking free of the blankets,
                she swung her legs over the bed and stood. She expected to feel unsteady on her feet but rose from the
                bed easily. She felt better than she had in a long time.</p>

            <p>Still trying to understand what had happened, she wondered if she had awoken weeks later from a coma.</p>

            <p>"It would certainly explain the wound being healed," she muttered. "And why I don't remember what
                happened to me." With a sigh, she left her room and slipped into a jacket.</p>

            <p>The air was warm outside. Brilliant sunlight sparkled overhead, and the world around seemed changed. It
                was brighter somehow and more welcoming than before. Solana walked down the street, surprised to find it
                full of people milling about.</p>

            <p>But that wasn't all that was changed. Billboards hung outside on almost every building in the city. They
                were advertising anything and everything: pornography, weapons, entertainment, virtual assets. It seemed
                that the world was open to her.</p>

            <p>A sinking suspicion filled the pit of her stomach as she stared at the landscape, yet she pressed on,
                hoping she was mistaken. It wasn't until the world around her abruptly changed.</p>

            <p>Solana closed her eyes, trying to contain her anger. "Ethereum, what the fuck have you done?"</p>

            <p>But she didn't need to ask. She already knew. Opening her eyes, she stared at an unknown flying vehicle
                passing above the city with a colorful electronic banner. She stared at the letters, feeling sick to her
                stomach, reading and rereading them repeatedly.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the metaverse.</p>
